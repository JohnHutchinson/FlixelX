FlixelX provides several additions to popular game library, flixel

FlxSaveWrapper - a safer way to deal with saving and loading game data from disk
See http://rubberduckygames.com/flxsavewrapper/

FlxBlinkSprite - just a sprite that blinks at a specified rate
FlxEmitterLite - lightweight particle emitter
FlxParticleLite - lightweight particle

FlxScreenAnchors - simple way to get the coordinates of the screen corners, regardless of resolution

FlxInputs - provides input abstraction so that you can bind game actions to input names instead of specific input devices or buttons.
At this time, you'll have to edit the file directly to bind your inputs. This functionality should really be
encapsulated, but I've been busy with other stuff.

FlxMouseWrapper - just a simple class to hide the mouse cursor on mobile devices, unless force show is set
FlxTouchButton - for overlaying buttons that work on mobile devices
FlxTouchButtonManager - 

FlxExtendedSound - extends a FlxSound so that its playback speed be changed dynamically

FlxTempo - stores FlxTones (FlxSounds) and plays them back on-tempo. Useful for music-based games




Flixel's code base feels very hackish to me, so I found myself having to go about things in a very hackish way as well,
in order to integrate with the system quickly and with minimal effort. As useful as it was, it's not likely that I'll be
spending much time on this project moving forward, since I've since abandoned Flixel and AS3 for Unity and C#. Feel free
to use these tools free of charge, for whatever use you wish, commerical or otherwise. No credit is expected, though it
is appreciated.

You can find out more about me or buy me a coffee at www.RubberDuckyGames.com if you so desire.

Enjoy!
